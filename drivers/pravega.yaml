# Pravega Driver Configuration for Vehicle Benchmark
# Optimized for elastic scaling and stream-based ordering

name: Pravega
driverClass: io.openmessaging.benchmark.driver.pravega.PravegaBenchmarkDriver

# Pravega client-specific configuration
client:
  controllerURI: tcp://localhost:9090
  scopeName: vehicles

# Writer configuration
writer:
  enableConnectionPooling: true

# Include timestamp in events for latency tracking
includeTimestampInEvent: true

# Enable auto-scaling for streams (recommended for vehicle use case)
enableStreamAutoScaling: true
eventsPerSecond: 10000

# Use custom payload format
customPayload: true

# Notes for Vehicle Use Case:
# - Pravega uses routing keys for ordering (vehicle ID as key)
# - Auto-scaling adjusts stream segments based on load
# - Scope "vehicles" will contain all benchmark streams
# - Connection pooling improves performance
