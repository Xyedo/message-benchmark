# Workload: 100,000 Vehicles - Location Data
# Scenario: GPS location updates from vehicles every 5 seconds
# Use Case: Real-time vehicle tracking and fleet management

name: vehicles-location-100k

# Topic Configuration
# 100 topics with 1,000 partitions each = 100,000 vehicles total
# Each partition represents one vehicle to ensure ordering
topics: 1
partitionsPerTopic: 1000

# Partitioning Strategy
# KEY_ORDER: Use vehicle ID as key to ensure all messages from same vehicle go to same partition
# This guarantees message ordering per vehicle
keyDistributor: KEY_ORDER
